A game for music lovers to test their knowledge of their favourite artists' songs.

Users get 5 lines of lyric from a randomly selected song and have to guess which artist the song is from.

**Key Features**
- Provides a "daily" page where every user gets the same lyric to guess, refreshes every day.
- "Infinite" page, where users can continue to guess randomly generated lyrics as long as they'd like
- Stores game results locally for displaying statistics such as win percentage, current win streak and best win streak.
